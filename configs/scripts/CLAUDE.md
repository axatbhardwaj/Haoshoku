# configs/scripts/

Executable user scripts deployed to `~/.local/bin/` by `installUserScripts()`
during the CachyOS setup flow. The destination precedes `/usr/bin/` in PATH on
systemd-user-session setups, so any file here whose basename matches a system
binary acts as a PATH-shadow wrapper for that binary.

## Files

| File              | What                                                    | When to read                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `game-performance` | PATH shadow of `/usr/bin/game-performance` (cachyos-settings). Toggles DP-1 VRR on + Caelestia gameMode on for the game's lifetime; reverts on exit/crash via trap. Calls the real cachyos-settings script after setup. | Adding more game-launch hooks (FPS overlays, env vars, etc.) or porting to a different monitor layout |

## Conventions

- Each file is `chmod 755` after deploy.
- Files starting with `.` are skipped (so e.g. a `.gitkeep` won't get installed).
- A script that shadows a system binary should always `exec` (or fall through to)
  the absolute system path so users who explicitly invoke `/usr/bin/X` get the
  unmodified original.
