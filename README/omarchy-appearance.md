## Omarchy appearance

[`configs/omarchy/appearance.json`](../configs/omarchy/appearance.json) declares a
public theme repository at an immutable Git commit, one background filename
inside that theme, and the font family. Full Arch setup and
`haoshoku --omarchy-appearance` reconcile the theme under
`~/.config/omarchy/themes/`, then call Omarchy's own theme, background, and font
commands. `haoshoku --discord-theme` then deploys that theme's Vencord CSS from
`configs/discord/theme.json` into Vesktop and Vencord, setting `enabledThemes`
while preserving every other settings key.

An existing checkout from another repository is never replaced. A matching
checkout with local changes is preserved and applied as-is; a clean matching
checkout advances to the declared commit. The manifest may identify exact
legacy revisions from older local-origin installs. Those recognized checkouts
are moved to a timestamped sibling backup before Haoshoku installs the clean
pinned theme, and a failed install restores the original checkout. This keeps
custom work recoverable while making a fresh laptop reproduce the tracked
appearance.
